        ``parse_float``, if specified, will be called with the string
        of every JSON float to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
        float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON floats (e.g. decimal.Decimal).

        ``parse_int``, if specified, will be called with the string
        of every JSON int to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
        int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON integers (e.g. float).

        ``parse_constant``, if specified, will be called with one of the
        following strings: -Infinity, Infinity, NaN.
